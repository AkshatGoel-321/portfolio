# Developer Portfolio – Akshat Goel

## 📌 Overview

This is my **personal developer portfolio** built using **React**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Vite**. It features a responsive design, dark/light mode toggle, animated UI elements, and sections to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information.

The project was created to strengthen my frontend development skills and to have a deployable portfolio I can use for internship and job applications.
